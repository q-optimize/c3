:math:`C^3` -  An integrated tool-set for control, calibration and characterization
===================================================================================

The :math:`C^3` software package provides tools to simulate and interact with experiments to perform common control and characterization tasks. Modules can be used individually or combined to achieve a certain goal. The main focus are three optimizations:

* :math:`C_1` Open-loop optimal control: Given a model, find the pulse shapes which maximize fidelity with a target operation.
* :math:`C_2`  Closed-loop calibration: Given pulses, calibrate their parameters to maximize a figure of merit measured by the actual experiment, thus improving beyond the limits of a deficient model.
* :math:`C_3`  Model learning: Given control pulses and their experimental measurement outcome, optimize model parameters to best reproduce the results.

When combined in sequence, these three procedures represent a recipe for system characterization.

*Note: This documentation is work-in-progress.*
